     * You have a sequence of positive numbers starting with 1, but one number is missing!
     * Find out the missing number; if the sequence is not broken, you should return 0.
     * Each sequence always increments by 1.
     *
     * In short: an invalid sequence (a string with non numeric character) must return 1,
     * an already complete (or empty) sequence must return 0;
     * a broken sequence with more than one number missing should return the lowest missing number;
     * otherwise return the missing number.
     *
     * Note that the input may be with random order.
     *
     * E.g.
     * BrokenSequence().findMissingNumber("1 3 2 5") // returns 4, because 4 is missing
     * BrokenSequence().findMissingNumber("1 2 3 4") // returns 0, because the sequence isn't broken
     * BrokenSequence().findMissingNumber("1 5") // returns 2, because the sequence is missing more than
     * one number and 2 is the lowest between 2, 3 and 4
     * BrokenSequence().findMissingNumber("2 1 4 3 a") // returns 1, because it's an invalid sequence.
     * in this case, it's invalid because contain a non numerical character
